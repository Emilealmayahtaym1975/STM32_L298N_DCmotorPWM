## 📑 Overview
Welcome to the STM32_L298N_DCmotorPWM project. This application is designed to help you easily control the speed and direction of DC motors using the STM32F103 Nucleo board along with the L298N driver. It uses Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for real-time control, making it a great tool for robotics and other embedded projects.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these simple steps. You will need an internet connection and a computer to download the necessary files.

### 🎯 Requirements
Make sure your setup meets the following requirements:
- **Computer**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **STM32F103 Nucleo Board**: Required for controlling the motor
- **L298N Motor Driver**: Required to interface with the DC motor
- **DC Motor**: The motor you wish to control
- **Power Supply**: Adequate power source for the motor
